# Suggesting Improvements in Supply chain using Machine learning and Linear Programming
**1.** We used linear programming to determine the optimal number of units to order for each Product
type and also for each SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) in a supply chain to minimize costs.

**Objective** is to minimize the total purchasing cost, which is calculated as the sum of products
purchased multiplied by their respective prices.

**Constraints** were to meet demand, where each SKU must have enough inventory to meet the
sales demand.

**Decision variables** : Non-Negative Orders  (number of units ordered for each
SKU) are constrained to be non-negative (you can't order a negative number of items).

**2.** Neural network implementation to Predict Delays
